    <h1>👑 LUDUS PRIME: AFRICA INSIGHT 🌍 (1:00 PM EAT)</h1>
    <p>Africa's $2.1 Billion gaming market is officially split:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Nigeria: 46.5 Million gamers (highest player count)</li>
        <li>Egypt: $368 Million projected revenue (2025)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Why the divide?</strong> One word: <strong>MONETIZATION.</strong></p>
    <h2>Nigeria vs. Egypt – The Player vs. Payer Gap</h2>
    <p>Egypt benefits from stronger payment infrastructure and higher spending power, allowing studios to monetize effectively.</p>
    <p>Nigeria, despite having 46.5M mostly mobile gamers, still struggles with frictionless game payments.</p>

    <h2>Mobile Dominance</h2>
    <p>Mobile accounts for over 89% of Africa’s gaming revenue. A mobile-first market by design.</p>

    <h2>The Future</h2>
    <p>With local payment solutions scaling, Nigeria's revenue may soon match its massive player base.</p>
    <p>Kenya ($46M revenue) continues rising as a high-growth market.</p>

    <h2>Closing</h2>
    <p>The story of African gaming is infrastructure meeting passion. Which country hits $500M first?</p>
